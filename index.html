								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>An avid Gamer and Games Programming (BSc Hons) Student at Staffordshire University.</p>
								<p>From birth, I was always surrounded by games, whether it was board games, or the PS1 & Original Xbox, there was always something to do. This exposure allowed me to rapidly grow knowledge about the world of gaming and games programming. I have a vast interest in a variety of games, such as League of Legends, Destiny 2, and the Call of Duty Franchise.
								<p>This interest pushed me down the career path of Games Programming, and thus I signed up for Staffordshire University to ensure a future in this field. In this portfolio you will find some of my projects, as well as a list of skill that I have developed at University.

									<h2>Pacman</h2>
									<p>My current University project is a pacman game. We were tasked to create pacman, but also advised to put our own twist on the game. Later down the line, I will revisit this project and hope to add a few more powerups to the game, like a Munchie Magnet (has a nice ring to it, don't you think?)</p>

									<h2>UKIE Game Jam</h2>
									<p>Not too long ago, me and my group (collectively known as "Bethesdn't") participated in the UKIE Game Jam. We were challenged to create a game to fit the theme of diversity and inclusiveness. For this we decided on a puzzle game, in which you control 3 different coloured Wizards that could open doors based on their colours, you can also mix the orbs to create colours, such as magenta and cyan. You must utilise all 3 colours to pass each level.</p>

									<h2>University Game Jam</h2>
									<p>During our first week of University, we were told to get into teams, and create a game. So me and the rest of Team Bethesdn't got to work on a Skyrim-themed First Person endless runner game. We were able to get 3rd place with this game, and we got to have a little bit of fun while creating the game, making the whole experience a very memorable one.</p>
